Installation
--
1. Python is required to run this script. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it.
3. Run the following commands in a terminal:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py
```
You will be taken through the setup process where you will be asked to provide your LionPath credentials, the semester you want to select, and other options.

Usage
--
Once the setup is complete, run the following commands in a terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```
The script will now run and automatically enroll you in your courses when they open.

Configuration
--
You can configure the script by editing the `config.py` file. The following options are available:
- `radnum`: Which semester to enroll in (which radio button to click starting from 1)
- `waitUntil12AM`: Wait for 12AM to enroll (for waiting for registration to open)
- `waitTimerEnable`: Wait until 3 minutes before 12AM to start the script (saves resources, but you can disable this to run the script manually)
- `restartOnError`: Restart the script if an error occurs (for example, if you get logged out of LionPath)
- `darkMode`: Dark Mode (sets the browser to dark mode, also sets the LionPath website to dark mode)
- `useTOTP`: TOTP Support for 2FA (TOTP must be enabled and set as the default method on your Microsoft account for this to work)
- `useBrave`: Brave Browser Support
- `useEdge`: Microsoft Edge Support
- `sendDiscordNotification`: Discord Webhook Integration (sends enrollment results to Discord via a webhook)
- `discordWebhookURL`: Discord Webhook URL (the webhook URL to send enrollment results to)

Discord Integration
--
This script is configured to send your enrollment results to Discord via a webhook. To enable this feature, you must first create a webhook in a Discord server. To do this, follow the steps below:
1. Open Discord and navigate to the server you want to send the enrollment results to.
2. Click the settings icon next to the server name and click "Integrations".
3. Click "Create Webhook".
4. Enter a name for the webhook and click "Copy Webhook URL".
5. Paste the webhook URL into the `discordWebhookURL` option in the `config.py` file.

You can learn more about Discord webhooks [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
